# Introduction to docker and docker-compose

In this tutorial, you will learn about docker and how to run containers.

Docker allows you to run your services inside containers. A container is a self contained package of your application and all dependencies required making it possible to run in any machine without any issues.

You can either package your application to a docker image or use some of the community images from docker hub or any image repository. 

A sample docker image is 'mysql' database image in docker hub https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql

Lets deploy mysql database and phpmyadmin to access the database.
