## Congratulations

You have successfully completed this scenario. 

We have learnt about services monitoring using Loki/Promtail/Prometheus and Grafana.

These tools provide a way to collect metrics and logs from running services and explore them in grafana. From there we can add more functionalities like dashboards, alerts etc.
