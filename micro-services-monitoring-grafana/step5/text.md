## Setting up the tools using a github sample library. You can skip upto here to setup a test environment easily and then come back from top to learn the components.

We have learnt how to setup all these tools individually. In this part, we will use our portainer instance to setup everything from promtail, grafana, loki, promtail and prometheus.

For this we will use a github repo https://github.com/gathecageorge/vps-monitoring-prometheus-loki

This repo sets up everything without doing it one at a time. Before doing this, we need to remove all of the services we have created so far.
